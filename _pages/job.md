## **[PSI Master's Program](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program){:target="_blank"}**

Perimeter Institute offers a condensed one-year program in collaboration with the University of Waterloo. Each year, Perimeter admits around 25 exceptional students from a multitude of countries. Those students are awarded a scholarship that covers costs such as tuition, meals and accommodations, among other necessities. Two phases of coursework include both foundational graduate-level subjects and modern topics from specific fields. Researchwise, students may choose to work under the guidance of Perimeter faculty members, such as myself, on research projects during the master program. 

**Fall 2024:** Applications are now being accepted for Perimeter Scholars International (PSI), the unique 10-month master’s program at Canada’s Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in partnership with the University of Waterloo. Features of the program include:

* No application fee.
* Removal of financial barriers: most students who receive and accept offers of admission to PSI will receive a full scholarship. Perimeter Institute also helps with travel arrangements and any immigration arrangements necessary.  
* Exposure to the full breadth of theoretical physics topics.
* Students are taught by leading minds in theoretical physics while earning a Master’s degree from the University of Waterloo.
* Academic excellence, inclusion, collaboration, creativity and innovation which are pillars of PSI values.
* Conducting research-driven coursework alongside some of the world's leading theoretical physicists. 
* PSI recruits worldwide: 85% of students come from outside of Canada
* PSI seeks extraordinary talent who may have non-traditional academic backgrounds, but have demonstrated exceptional scientific aptitude.
