## **[PSI Master's Program](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program){:target="_blank"}**

Perimeter Institute offers a condensed one-year program in collaboration with the University of Waterloo. Each year, Perimeter admits around 25 exceptional students from a multitude of countries. Those students are awarded a scholarship that covers costs such as tuition, meals and accommodations, among other necessities. Two phases of coursework include both foundational graduate-level subjects and modern topics from specific fields. Researchwise, students may choose to work under the guidance of Perimeter faculty members, such as myself, on research projects during the master program. 

**Fall 2024:** Applications are now being accepted for Perimeter Scholars International (PSI), the unique 10-month master’s program at Canada’s Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in partnership with the University of Waterloo. Features of the program include:

* No application fee.
* Removal of financial barriers: most students who receive and accept offers of admission to PSI will receive a full scholarship. Perimeter Institute also helps with travel arrangements and any immigration arrangements necessary.  
* Exposure to the full breadth of theoretical physics topics.
* Students are taught by leading minds in theoretical physics while earning a Master’s degree from the University of Waterloo.
* Academic excellence, inclusion, collaboration, creativity and innovation which are pillars of PSI values.
* Conducting research-driven coursework alongside some of the world's leading theoretical physicists. 
* PSI recruits worldwide: 85% of students come from outside of Canada
* PSI seeks extraordinary talent who may have non-traditional academic backgrounds, but have demonstrated exceptional scientific aptitude.

## **[Postdoctoral Fellowship at Perimeter](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/jobs/perimeter-postdoctoral-program){:target="_blank"}**

Each year Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics invites applications for postdoctoral positions, including named fellowships, from new and recent PhDs working in fundamental theoretical physics. Most postdoctoral positions are offered for a period of three years and four or five years oppotunities are also available. [Quantum information](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/quantum-information-0){:target="_blank"} is one of the research areas at Perimeter that hires postdocs. Postdoctoral fellows at Perimeter have extensive freedoms in choosing their research topics and multiple collaboration opportunities with both faculty members at Perimeter and at the University of Waterloo. 

**Fall 2024:**

## **[PhD Student](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/phd-students){:target="_blank"}**

PhD students supervised by Faculty at Perimeter Institute receive their degree from a partnering university where their supervisor has a full or adjunct appointment. To apply to become a PhD student in my group, please apply to [PhD Programs at Department of Physics and Astronomy]( https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/graduate-studies/phd-programs) at the University of Waterloo (either [Physics](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/future-students/programs/physics-phd-quantum-information-waterloo) track or [Physics (Quantum Information)](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/future-students/programs/physics-phd-quantum-information-waterloo) track) and indicate my name in the essays. Please also apply to [PhD Residency Program Award](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/phd-students) at Perimeter simultaneously to gain additional benefits (beyond being a PhD student at UWaterloo) including additional resources and funding. 

**Deadline is January 9 for admission in September 2024.**

## **Summer Research**

I welcome undergraduate students who would like to do a summer research project with me. Please apply to [PSI Start Program](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-start-program) if you need financial support. Perimeter Institute invites students to join its world-leading research community for a part-time 10-week online school in theoretical physics beginning in May 2024. In addition, some of these students will also come to Perimeter for an in-person paid research internship. The students accepted as interns will be fully immersed in Perimeter’s renowned research environment, work on projects alongside Perimeter researchers, and potentially even publish their work.
